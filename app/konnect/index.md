## Introducing {{site.konnect_short_name}}

{{site.konnect_short_name}} is an API lifecycle
management platform designed from the ground up for the cloud native era
and delivered as a service. This platform lets you build modern applications
better, faster, and more securely. The management plane is hosted
in the cloud by Kong, while the runtime engine, {{site.base_gateway}} — Kong's
lightweight, fast, and flexible API gateway  — is managed by you within your
preferred network environment.

{{site.konnect_short_name}} helps simplify multi-cloud API management by:

* Offering a single management plane to deploy and manage your APIs and microservices in any environment: cloud, on-premises, Kubernetes, and virtual machines.

* Instantly applying authentication, API security, and traffic control policies consistently across all your services using powerful enterprise and community plugins.

* Providing a real-time, centralized view of all your services. Monitor golden signals such as error rate and latency for each service and route to gain deep insights into your API products.

## {{site.konnect_short_name}} modules

### Service Hub

[Service Hub](/konnect/servicehub) makes internal APIs discoverable,
consumable, and reusable for internal development teams. Catalog
all your services through the Service Hub to create a single source of
truth for your organization’s service inventory. By leveraging Service Hub,
your application developers
can search, discover, and consume existing services to accelerate their
time-to-market, while enabling a more consistent end-user experience
across the organization’s applications.

or create custom teams with any roles you choose. Invite users and add them to these teams to manage user
access. You can also map groups from your existing identity provider into {{site.konnect_short_name}} teams.
